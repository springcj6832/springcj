                           The GrowBox is a hands-off approach to growing the perfect plant.  There are many reasons
                           we give ourselves not to grow plants- you might not be able to 
                           grow specific plants due to your geological climate, or maybe you dont have the space for growing plants, or maybe you dont have a green thumb (like me).
                           <br><br>
                           I am developing the perfect growing chamber for any specific plant, in your own enviornment- hydroponic or soil based.
                           The goal is to develop units controlled by a small computer that monitors water, light, temperature, and ventilation.  
                           These can be controlled from the device, a hub if connected to multiple at a time, or eventually from your phone.

                                As you might guess, currently we are not selling these products yet, we are currently working on perfecting
                                the design and elements before we can release it to public.  We will be begginning the testing period soon with this
                                product on multiple different plants from vastly differing genomes.  We believe this product will work, and are extremely
                                hopeful.
