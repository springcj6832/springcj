                                I believe I met the expectations above, not simply because I worked my tail off to understand the code, but to really create a sandbox to develop off of.  The ONLY issue I came across, was the SSL CERTIFICATION.  I believe truly that I would have been able to understand it, but everyone I asked for assistance gave me advice on how to get it to run.  I went to the TA’s hours, and they had no idea what was causing it, I went to tutors, I tried searching forums, I bought two domains to test out what could cause this issue(hostgator and godaddy), I still haven’t been able to figure it out.  I have never felt so stumped on an assignment.  I feel upset that I couldn’t get it working, but I still am proud for the other things I still accomplished.   I truly believe for a website from scratch, it has turned out amazingly.  I am proud that I perfected the design elements and style.  I believe that with the startup I am a part of, this would be a great base to start off of.  Enough of me rambling though, here’s an itemized breakdown.
                                    <br><br>
                                (in order from expectations)
                                <br>
                                1.	The website was developed for a startup that includes a few of my friends and i.<br>
                                2.	There is a header for the site<br>
                                3.	There are 5 separate pages, each meaningful and reasonable for the design<br>
                                4.	There are navigation links<br>
                                5.	There are different layouts for screen dimensions.<br>
                                6.	There is a design style that exists throughout the content of the site<br>
                                7.	There are plenty of images that all include alt text<br>
                                8.	Each page has a favicon<br>
                                9.	The files are organized, file for images, separate css file<br>
                                10.	I built the site from scratch.<br>
                                11.	There are a few errors, but none that don’t exist that would complicate the code<br>
                                12.	The site is stored in a git repository<br>
                                13.	The files are properly named and cased<br>
                                14.	The site is served out on port 8443<br>
                                15.	This is the only thing I struggled with.  I spent all night the past few nights working to find out this, im going crazy from it not working.  I am afraid almost to find out what is wrong, in fear that it was simple and underneath everyone’s noses.
                                <br>   16.	The content is extremely organized
                                <br>17.	There are a few different font faces
                                <br>18.	There is a submission form(isn’t linked to a webserver, however)
                                <br>19.	There are links to social media accounts, for the website.
                                <br>20.	My code is readable, I tried to make it as legible as possible.
                                <br>21.	The images on refresh animate from square to rounded.
                                <br>I am bummed that I couldn’t figure out the SSL, and am somewhat defeated by this fact, I hope to learn what caused this issue, and learn from these issues, and the amount of time I spent trying to discover the issue is somewhat admirable. (depressingly so haha)

                                He wanted to see more images of the actual product, but as there aren’t any at this current moment, 
                                He is happy with how everything was looking, he also suggests that we get a webservice involved.

                                Jack response:
                                Jack was a fan of the “iphone” aesthetic, giving the site a clean and trendy look.  He wishes there was e-commerce involved.

                                My response:
                                I envisioned the product to blow peoples mind, and my own.  I was so caught up in 
                                Trying to figure out the ssl stuff I felt like that impacted my perception of the quality of the final result
                                I am impressed with how organized and aesthetically pleasing the site turned out to be.  I really enjoyed making the color schemes.
