                            <p class="a">We have been ordering parts for the box element of our growbox. The issue with
                                a startup during these strange times, is that the
                                ordering of new parts can sometimes take awhile. We are struggling to get items from
                                suppliers during this time.
                                We are looking into different industrial metal storage shelves, this is one of the
                                hardest products to come by currently. We arent however
                                having trouble searching for carbon filters and sensors for the atmosphere. Its just a
                                very odd time to be creating and testing our designs.

                                <br /><br />
                                In other news, our design elements for the Raspberry Pi computer has been going great.
                                We are starting to build
                                plant profiles that we would assume work once implimented, however, without a box, we
                                might have to delay physical testing for the time being.
                                <br />
                                With these delays, we might be posting in less regular intervals, keep up to date with
                                us on our social media, we will continue to post there. Hope you all are well and
                                healthy.
                                Thank you for your support and understanding in these strange times.

                                <p class="a">Our site is up! Finally after weeks of design choices
                                    and elements, weve decided that we want our site to be
                                    clean and simple. We want the focus our work on the accessability
                                    and focus on tech. Our asthetic and design choices of the webite mimic the product
                                    we'd hope to create.

                                    In other news, we've ordered all the parts for the computer portion of the GrowBox.
                                    If you'd like to see, we are taking
                                    inspiration from another device. Here is the link to the inspiration of our computer
                                    design.
